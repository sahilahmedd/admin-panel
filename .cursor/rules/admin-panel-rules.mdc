# 🧠 Project Rules for Cursor AI – Admin Panel (Next.js)

## 📁 Folder Structure
- Pages go inside `app/` (App Router).
- Components go in `src/components/`, grouped by domain (e.g., pages/, forms/, ui/).
- API logic lives in `src/api/` or `app/api/` (depending on backend/frontend split).
- Reusable hooks go in `src/hooks/`.

---

## 🧱 UI & Styling
- Use `shadcn/ui` components as base (e.g., Button, Dialog, Input).
- Use `Tailwind CSS` for all custom styles.
- All components should be responsive.
- Keep UI clean, flat, and admin-like (use gray tones, accent primary buttons).

---

## 🧭 Layout & Navigation
- Use a sidebar layout with breadcrumbs for navigation clarity.
- All pages should include a `<Breadcrumbs />` component at the top.
- Use consistent page titles with `<CardTitle>` and actions (e.g., "Add +").

---

## 🧑‍💻 TypeScript Rules
- Use strict typing for `formData`, `API responses`, and `prisma` models.
- Avoid `any`. If unavoidable, isolate with comment and reason.
- Always infer types from Prisma when possible using `typeof` or generated types.

---

## 📝 Forms
- Use controlled components (`value`, `onChange`) only.
- Group inputs logically with proper labels and spacing.
- Use `onChange` handler with field-type safety (handle checkboxes, inputs, textareas correctly).
- Boolean flags like `active_yn` should be 1 or 0 (not true/false).

---

## 🔄 API Handling
- Always show a toast on success or failure (use `react-hot-toast`).
- Standard API response format:
  ```ts
  {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    data?: any;
  }
